# Font icons for Leaflet markers

Leaflet markers that use resolution-independent font glyphs as icons.

This lets you display markers at any
size without degradation of quality.  You don't need to worry about the
resolution of the display, retina displays work as well as any other, and you can
adjust the size of the marker to the map level being displayed.

This [demo](http://cilogi.github.com/cilogi-marker/index.html)
shows the main features of the markers, and provides information on the API.
